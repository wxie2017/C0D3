# My Learning process in C0D3

This is my first github trial project. I wish I could use gitlab instead of github.
However, the login is broken for me in gitlab.

Anyway, I will use the project to record every step that I have done during my
learning in [[https://www.c0d3.com/][C0D3]].

The goal is to see if I become a well-trained software Engineer after this journey.


# Registration

The [[https://www.c0d3.com/signup][signup]] page is easy. You fill in

* email
* username
* First name
* Last name

There will be message displayed after you press the "Create Account" button. I was
told that hotmail account is not ok for email, and gmail worked for me.

If everything is ok, after you clicked on the "Create Account" button, you will
get an email with a link to login and reset your password. Then, you should be
able to access the [[https://www.c0d3.com/curriculum][curriculum]].
