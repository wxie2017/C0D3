# JS 0 - Foundations

* Strings
A string can be words, sentences, or a bunch of characters. To make a string,
you can use double quotes `"` , single quotes `'`, or ``` (the key to the left
of 1 on most keyboards).
* Template Literals (Template Strings)
Using ``` (backticks) and `${expression}` (placeholder) allows us to put the
variables directly into the string.

** Exercise: Rewrite the `story` variable to use ```
original code:
#+BEGIN_SRC js
const actor = "We"
const location = "farmers' market"

const story = actor + " plan to go to a " + location + " tomorrow"
#+END_SRC

rewritten code:
#+BEGIN_SRC js
const actor = "We"
const location = "farmers' market"

const story = `${actor} plan to go to a ${location} tomorrow`

console.log(story)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: We plan to go to a farmers' market tomorrow
: undefined
* Truthy / Falsey
**Falsey:** There are only **six falsey values** in JavaScript:

`false`, `0`, `""` (empty string), `undefined`, `null`, `NaN` (Not a Number)

**Truthy: EVERYTHING ELSE** is truthy!
|-----------+--------+-----------------|
| data type | Falsey | Truthy          |
|-----------+--------+-----------------|
| Number    | 0, NaN | Everything else |
|-----------+--------+-----------------|
| String    | ""     | Everything else |
|-----------+--------+-----------------|
| Boolean   | false  | true            |
|-----------+--------+-----------------|
